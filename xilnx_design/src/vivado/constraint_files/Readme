In this folder are the contraint files that need to be imported into vivado to ensure that all the io pins and pmod adc boards are correctly connected to fabric. The various IO pins map the output pins to different regions of the debug board depending on how many pins you wish to expose. It is also possible that you will have to rename the pins in the constraint files to match the pin names in your vivado block design, but the FPGA pin mappin should not be changed. In addition, there is an Excel file describing the pin mappins that are possible on the debug board.
